## Key Design Decisions

### Component-Based Architecture

The application is divided into reusable components to improve readability and maintainability.

### State Management

React hooks (`useState`) are used to manage:

* Selected date range
* Month and year navigation
* Dark mode

### Separation of Concerns

* Logic is placed in `utils/`
* Static data is stored in `data/`
* UI components are organized in `components/`

### User Experience

* Clear visual feedback for selections
* Smooth and intuitive interactions
* Clean and minimal interface

---

## Future Improvements

* Persist notes using localStorage
* Add animations for month transitions and range selection
* Add event/reminder support
* Integrate real holiday APIs
